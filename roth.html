        <h2>Roth IRA meaning </h2>
        <p> A Roth IRA(Indivdual Retirement Account) is an account that offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A Roth IRA is a great choice for individuals who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement then they currently are. It is also beneficial to those who want to diversify their retirement savings beyond traditional tax-deferred accounts.
        </p>

        <h2> Benefits of a Roth IRA</h2>
        <p> At retirement, the major benefit of a Roth IRA is that you will be able to withdraw your money without it ever being taxed. What your account has generated is all yours to keep. </p>
            <p> </p>

        <h2>Withdrawing Before 59.</h2>
            <p>Although it is not recommended to withdraw money, emergencies can happen. If you make any withdrawal before 59, you may have to pay taxes and penalties on those earnings.</p>
            <p>Only withdraw the amount you need, if you withdraw too much, you may not be able to place it back into the account since contributions are capped at $6,000.00 a year.</p>
        <h2> When to open up a Roth IRA</h2>
            <p>The sooner the better. Unlike a 401k, contributions are capped at $6,000.00 a year, therefore time is the key to generating a fruitful retirement account that will be tax-free.</p>
